# Wendi Examples
Notebooks that will appear on NuGrid wendi or AstroHub servers that demonstrate 
NuGrid tools, such as the exploration of NuGrid Set1 data.

If you have added an example the Docker image of the jupyterhub server needs to 
rebuilt (@fherwig).

On this repository only notebooks are allowed that work on the Astrohub and 
Wendi-silver. Links to these servers: http://www.nugridstars.org
