# Exploring NuGrid data

This repo contains examples of how to use the [NuGridPy](https://nugrid.github.io/NuGridPy) tools to explore the [NuGrid data sets](http://www.nugridstars.org/data-and-software/yields/set-1), for example on the [Web-Exploration of NuGrid Data Interactive (WENDI)](https://wendi.nugridstars.org).

`Star_explore.ipynb` is a general exploration notebook, and a good starting point.
In the _Examples_ directory we provide a wide range of examples that each demonstrate certain aspects of analysing data. 

These examples live in the [NuGrid](https://github.com/NuGrid) [wendi-examples](https://github.com/NuGrid/wendi-examples) GitHub repository.

These examles and more can be executed on the [Web-Exploration of NuGrid Data Interactive (WENDI)](https://wendi.nugridstars.org). Please feel free to add examples by making a pull request on the GitHub [wendi-examples](https://github.com/NuGrid/wendi-examples) repo. The examples must work on the WENDI server though.
